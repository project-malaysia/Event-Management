# The type of project we wish to be marked for is WEB.

Welcome to the repository for our project. This document provides you with all the necessary information to get started with our web application, including how to run it locally, explore the codebase on GitHub, access the live websites, and log in for testing purposes.

## GitHub Repository

To explore or download the source code, visit our GitHub repository:

https://github.com/project-malaysia/Event-Management


## Running the websites locally

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, please download and install it from here: https://nodejs.org/en

Follow these steps to run the websites on your local environment:

1. Open PowerShell (or your preferred terminal) and navigate to the project's root directory you have download. The root directory must finish either at /admin or /user.
2. Execute the following command to start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Once the server is running, you can access the website through your web browser at the local address provided in the terminal output clicking ' o ' letter (open) and then the click the enter button.

## Accessing the Websites

We have organised our project into two separate folders and websites to showcase our work. This division was necessary because the Sign In component is not functioning as intended. Ideally, it should operate differently based on the user's role. Specifically, if an admin signs in, he or she should have access to features such as updating text, adding events, and deleting events in about, privacy policy, terms of service pages, and in the calendar events. However, if anyone else signs in, these options should not be available or displayed. 

This functionality was a crucial aspect assigned to the team member responsible for the Sign In component. However, due to the aforementioned limitations, we opted to present our work through separate files and websites.

The website is publicly accessible at the following URL links:

https://w21004471.nuwebspace.co.uk/kv6002/website/admin/  as an admin

https://w21004471.nuwebspace.co.uk/kv6002/website/user/   as anyone else user
